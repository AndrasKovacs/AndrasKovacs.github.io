I'm a postdoc at the [Logic and Types
group](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-organisation/logic-and-types-lt) at the
University of Gothenburg. Previously I was an assistant lecturer at the [Faculty
of Informatics of Eötvös Loránd University of
Budapest](https://www.inf.elte.hu/en/), at the department of Programming
Languages and Compilers. I did my PhD studies at the same place from 2017 to
2021 under the supervision of [Ambrus Kaposi](https://akaposi.github.io/).

My research topics are generally related to type theory, and they range from
"applied" type theory (compilation, elaboration, performance, metaprogramming)
to more "pure" type theory (metatheory of inductive types, universes).
