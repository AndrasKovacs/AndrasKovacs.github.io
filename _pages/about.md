I'm an assistant lecturer and PhD candidate at the [Faculty of Informatics of
Eötvös Loránd University of Budapest](https://www.inf.elte.hu/en/), at the
department of Programming Languages and Compilers. I did my PhD studies at the
same place from 2017 to 2021 under the supervision of [Ambrus
Kaposi](https://akaposi.github.io/).

My research topics are generally related to type theory, and they range from
"applied" type theory (compilation, elaboration, performance) to more "pure"
type theory (metatheory of inductive types, universes).
